# MongooseEx Instructions
Exercise for mongoose to learn how to save and retrieve documents. 

To get started, git clone this repository. Since this is your own exercise, you DO NOT need to push or commit your work to this repository.

You MUST have a working instance of mongoDB running before your app will work. Otherwise you won't have anywhere to save your documents.

# Exercise 
You need to finish this todo app. 

In order to do this, you will need to complete two routes, '/addTodo' and '/' . You should complete the '/addTodo' route
first before the '/' route. 

You should NOT have to touch the front end files, only app.js . 

Please take note of the hints i've left you. 

After this, you should be able to add todos and they should display on the page under the input box. 
As a bonus, try adding delete functionality, you will need to edit the front end for this and create a new route in app.js.
